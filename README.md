# DTSC-2302 Final Project

If you are a collaborator, for ease of use, create a python virtual environment (do not commit the environment when making changes). 

Install necessary packages in order to run and edit notebooks as needed!

To create a python environment in Visual Studio Code, follow the steps below:
1. Open Visual Studio Code
2. Open the project folder (if you are reading this, you have likely completed steps 1 and 2 already)
3. Open your command palette. If you're on Windows, press and hold `ctrl` + `shift` + `p`. If you're on MacOS, press and hold `cmd` + `shift` + `p`.
4. As long as you have the python extensions in VS Code installed (very likely), search for 'Python: Create Environment...' and select it.
5. Select your base interpreter and you're good to go!
